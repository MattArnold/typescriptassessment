## Assumptions:

If two items in the input have the same name, they will also be input with the same price.

An item will always be input starting with the numeral 1; if there are multiples, they will be entered as different lines.

## Design Explanation:

I used this assessment to teach myself Typescript, which I have never used before. I usually write in a functional paradigm, but Typescript is not limited to a strictly Object-Oriented paradigm. Functional components in React are supported in Typescript with the `FC` type.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The files with the work directly relevant to the assessment requirements are src/App.tsx, the src/controllers folder, the src/components folder, and src/ItemPriceController.test.tsx.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start` or `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `yarn test` or `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
